# Commercial project for future shop
It was my pet-project for payment. An example for it was ---> https://stickeronline.ru/
Used framework was Bootstrap with wrote custom styles.
In fact, it was the first try to use adaptive layout. Maybe its not the best attemp to use custom bootstrap's styles directly inside of *ALL* divs/rows and etc, but for  me thats a good chance to improve my knowledge :)
